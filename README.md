Inspiration ->
Concerned with the security issues in the Howard University Campus, we have developed an app that'll help students to reach their destination safe and sound.
What it does
Bison Safe is a web-based application that helps campus security to track the people who feel insecure while walking nearby the campus. The user interface lets an user to send his geo coordinates to the admin panel(police station) and in turn, admin panel can monitor and help the students to remain safe.
How we built it
We used LeafletJs and Mapbox for creating the interactive maps for the front end side. And, we initiaized a real time Firebase for transmitting the data from the admin panel(generally our frontend side) with the Ionic hybrid app. Our hybrid app is a simple hybrid app that helps student to safeguard themselves and call the emergency number at  the time of trouble.
Challenges we ran into
We had some problems while connecting Leafletjs with the Iconic App. Also, due to some CSS overrides, there was problem in rendering HTML.
What we learned
Life is very difficult without sleep.
